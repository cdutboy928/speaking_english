嘴巴张开，舌头抬起时贴住软腭，阻止气流从口腔泄出,软腭下垂，气流从鼻腔泄出，同时震动声带发声
ŋ是个浊辅音，声带振动
和拼音中的ng很像，可以先把拼音中的ang,ing,eng练一下
放到单词里面读就行

舌头轻轻停在上牙后面
先发音然后把舌头轻舔在上颚
![LightL&DarkL](lightL&darkL.png)
### Light L
![LightL](lightl.png)  
区分l和n，l是舌尖一点抵住上颚，n是舌头大面积抵住上颚
![LightLvsN](lightlvsn.png)  

### Dark L
![DarkL](darkl.png)  
舌头后缩
![吁呜](吁呜.png)  
发这两个音时，口型要保持不变，只是舌头伸和缩
![哈欠](哈欠.png)  
打哈欠体会舌头收缩
![不要用嘴型做](不要用嘴型做.png)  
Dark L不要用嘴唇做，嘴唇基本不动，用舌头收缩发音。如果用嘴唇就会发成O的音
不必要全头用力,舌头灵活伸缩

###  dark L主要是舌根用力上抬，舌尖可以在后期贴上牙后牙龈，以便于后面变成light L连读:吁呜ld
![Reachel DarkL](reacheldarkl.gif)  
###  注意l如果跟后面的元音拼的话就不用发dark l的音了，feeling, tallest, I fell over yesterday.
### 美语里l不与后面的ju拼
   value
   volume
   w
## !!!r
## 音节
一个元音(包括单元音和双元音)是一个音节  
重读就是那个元音拉长些，音调升高些  
英文发音中有发完整和一半就收住，这点跟中文不同

## 重读
重读就是加长所重读音节里的元音
Canada Canada
banana
Biology
photography photography
I love it.
I have to call him.
Skyscraper

句子里重读的单词一样也要加长所重读单词的元音
I love my class.
I love my new job.
You're really tall.
It's hot.
Let's go to the park.
I got a job at the hospital.
## Reduced vowels
结尾不强调的音弱化成ə
symbol
Local
Local
record
一般介词不强调的时候也会弱化成ə，比如at, for, in, on, with, by等。这些接触要读的很轻
O'clock ə
Look at me ət
I'd like to talk to you 
I'd like tə talk tə you
I'm looking for you
I'm looking fər you
Let's meet at 2:00
I'd like to talk to the pilot
Let's meet for breakfast.
I'd love to go for a walk
I'd love to go for a walk.
## [θ] thick, throw, bath   
Think
Thank
North
South 
Mouth
Take a bath
Choose a path
th在最后的时候，前面的元音要发圆满稍长，然后用舌头尖或者舌头中部通过舌头左右搅动发出呲气声

## [ɾ] riddle, booty, center
Better
getting better
Ladder
Later
writing a letter
Doesn't matter
Little bit
Attack 
Not at all 先not at, then at all
A little bit of
I'm a writer ai要发圆满，弹舌要轻一点。
Let it go let it go play it again let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go （it的t虽然不发音，但是有发音的动作，所以会造成i后面稍微的停顿）
Nobody
Get up 
What's the matter 
The butter tastes bitter
Do you want some better butter
get out of here.  get out.  out of
all over
Take over take over take over
## 连读
ju其实算半元音，可以和其前面的辅音连读
Thank you kju
It's very kind of you vju
Feel excited
Confidence is the difference. 这里的confidence和is不连读，因为要强调confidence。一般不是句子里强调的关键词才连读。
Sing a song不连读
## [ŋ]   think, sing, tongue  
Iŋ后面连读的话化成n  
think  
Each has his own task and nobody's dispensable.  
Each has his own task and nobody's dispensable.
连读是自然的，不要为了连读而连读，连读的时候要想着连读前的单词，并注意节奏。
h的略读还是有一点h的
## [ʔ] rent, button, cotton
![喉塞音方法](喉塞音方法.png)
还是要做要发t或者d的动作的
喉塞音
when t or d followed by n
T的吞音，像嗯又不像嗯的音,丹田发音
会导致前面的元音略微变短
喉塞音的关键在于前面元音的收住和停顿。
uh oh
Important
eaten
Certainly
Certainly
Beaten
Hidden
In the garden
Midnight

Button button
What I eat in a day
What I eat in a day
## [ɑr]注意儿化音
garden
## 清浊
清音不送气
清音声带不震动
浊音声带震动
还有清音不送气的，不是浊音
有些不送气的清音发出来感觉声带震动的浊音是因为带着后面的元音，所有的元音都是浊音
汉语里面的bdg实际上不是浊音，而是清音不送气
### 浊音
念出足够浊的浊音，或者说避免发成你说的"不送气清音"，我们的确可以采用在bdg等浊塞音前加一个相对应的鼻音m/n/ng来带动这个塞音。但是m只适用于同样是双唇音的b；而d更适合加n，g前加ng。
所以，my baby的夸张浊音读法为：my m~mbaby! （m的持续时间根据你个人喜好控制）
这种方法需要注意的地方在于，并不是见到bdg等浊塞音就要在前面加鼻音，因为得看是否重读，以及前面是否有清音食之清化。
比如I know he's a baby, but I didn't know he's a fat baby.
前半句的baby因为是被强调的，而且前面是元音a，所以浊化程度比较高。
后半句的baby因为不被强调（旧信息），而且前面的是清音t，所以浊化程度很低，甚至没有。
### 清清浊浊
单词后面加s，清音后面就发清音s，浊音后面就发浊音z
![清清浊浊](清清浊浊.png)
## 重读
重读就是加长所重读音节里的元音
## Fully pronouncing each consonant
要发饱满
Don't take any shortcuts instead of fully pronouncing each consonant.
Fully move your lips.
Probably
Fully move your tongue
General
Pronouncing each sound doesn't mean having to speak very slowly.
Don't be lazy
