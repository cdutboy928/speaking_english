## consonants

### n

/n/:微微张开嘴巴，舌尖紧贴上齿龈，形成阻碍。气流从鼻腔泄出，同时声带震动发出声音。n/是个鼻音、浊辅音，依靠声音震动发声，当/n/出现在音节结尾处时要略微延长。/ŋ/:嘴唇张开，舌后部抬起贴住软腭，阻止气流从口腔泄出。 2）软腭下垂，气流从鼻腔泄出，同时震动声带发音。 放在熟悉的单词中去感受，sin，sing

![tongue position of n](n.jgp)

* Sign 
* fine
* 9
### t&d&l&n
发这三个音的时候舌尖都不要碰到牙齿，碰牙龈。n的舌头大面积接触牙龈

齿龈-牙根周围的粉红色黏膜组织，内有血管和神经。通称牙床。如果碰到了牙齿就往回收一些，碰到牙根没关系。

### [ŋ] 
嘴巴张开，舌头抬起时贴住软腭，阻止气流从口腔泄出,软腭下垂，气流从鼻腔泄出，同时震动声带发声,ŋ是个浊辅音，声带振动

#### the 'ING' sound

Iŋ是后鼻音，舌头后部上贴，跟发“哥”音的位置相近，舌头不用放松下来，或者就放下来一丢丢。

* working
* Doing
* Going
* thinking
* Sing
* Interesting
* I am thinking about buying the ring.
* Who are you bringing to the wedding?
* I know swimming, running, and playing tennis.
* Iŋ后面连读的话化成n  
* think  
* Each has his own task and nobody's dispensable.  
* Each has his own task and nobody's dispensable.
连读是自然的，不要为了连读而连读，连读的时候要想着连读前的单词，并注意节奏。

h的略读还是有一点h的
* think, sing, tongue
* Long lɔŋ  要落回到鼻音上
* monkey
* Swimming
* running
* Sing

### l

舌头轻轻停在上牙后面,先发音然后把舌头轻舔在上颚,l只发前半部分的了

* Tall
* Feel
* Girl
* He will 
* He'll
* Well  甚至可以试着把后半部分发出来读成“well了”

![LightL&DarkL](lightL&darkL.png)

#### Light L

![LightL](lightl.png)  

区分l和n，l是舌尖一点抵住上颚，n是舌头大面积抵住上颚

![LightLvsN](lightlvsn.png)  

#### Dark L

![DarkL](darkl.png)  

舌头后缩

![吁呜](吁呜.png)  

发这两个音时，口型要保持不变，只是舌头伸和缩

![哈欠](哈欠.png)  

打哈欠体会舌头收缩

![不要用嘴型做](不要用嘴型做.png)  

Dark L不要用嘴唇做，嘴唇基本不动，用舌头收缩发音。如果用嘴唇就会发成O的音

不必要全头用力,舌头灵活伸缩

dark L主要是舌根用力上抬，舌尖可以在后期贴上牙后牙龈，以便于后面变成light L连读:吁呜ld,deal分三部分:第一是dea舌头正常发i；第二步发darkL的前半部分即舌根部分用力上抬，注意这时舌尖不要卷起；第三步舌尖伸出贴上颚发lightL的位置。

#### Lisa's method is better and more useful

![Lisa's dark L](Lisadarkl.gif)

**so the tongue is relax and it touches right behind the upper teeth and it stays there. So the American L is prolonged. It's softer and longer.舌头放轻松放在牙龈和上颚交接的突起处，轻放，温柔并拉长。大舌头的感觉。就是后面lou把ou不发出声音，并且舌头改为轻放**

* she'll
* I'll
* he'll
* I'm calling you to tell you about the film.
* I feel terrible about the political scandal.
* I think I'll be able to handle it by myself.
* You will do well at school.
#### elk
We're going to add a k at the end of the word and say the word ELQ.

The K is pronounced with the back of your tongue raised and this will help you feel the placement of the tongue for the dark L.

**注意l如果跟后面的元音拼的话就不用发dark l的音了，feeling, tallest, I fell over yesterday.**

#### 美语里l不与后面的ju拼
* value
* volume
* w
### R [r] core, hard, real

The American R is never silent. 

The tip of your tongue should never touch the top behind your upper teeth. The tip of your tongue curls and we pull it back.

基本上就是北京的儿化音。

* Your
* Four
* More
* other
* Learn
* German
* Robert
* First person
* Their computer isn't working.
* I gave her the four other pictures.
* Her fourth birthday is on Thursday.
* Her fourth birthday is on Thursday.
* There are many more over there.
* We were the first to arrive at the park.

### [θ] thick, throw, bath   [ð]   other, then, bathe
* is the: 先发iz，然后发th时舌尖抵上牙尖代替咬舌
* Think
* Thank
* North
* South 
* Mouth
* Take a bath
* Choose a path

th在最后的时候，前面的元音要发圆满稍长，然后用舌头尖或者舌头中部通过舌头左右搅动发出呲气声

Be careful that your tongue doesn't touch too hard on your other teeth. Because if it does then you're not going to have any air coming through. You're going to be blocking the airflow. Make sure that your tongue slightly touch it. 

If your tongue is too far inside and if it's not touching the teeth, the sound is going to be [s] instead of [θ].

Make sure that your tongue touches the teeth. It doesn't to be very visible. If you speak like that it could slow down your speech. Song if you noticed American people don't stick out to that tone very much when they're producing the th. But they do touch the teeth with the tongue.

舌头有伸出来一部分，不伸出来就会像s、z；但是不要咬紧，要轻些, 要有气流可以流出，咬紧就会像t d。大概伸出舌头的过了舌尖肉厚的那个地方轻一点就行了。大舌头的感觉。

* bath
* both
* math
* Thank you
* Thursday
* father
* Mother
* Thirsty
* I'm thirsty. Is there anything to drink in this place?
* I thought it was on Thursday at 3:30.
* This is my fourth month studying math.
* Both my mother and my father are healthy.
* Both my mother and my father are healthy.
* I think Matthew lives in the North.
* with
### s&z
上了音标课才发现is，was，he‘s，she's里面的s音标都是/z/，为什么这么多年都完全没听出来呢，感觉美剧电影里他们读的也是/s/。

/z/读的很轻时确实听上去像s，这个听音辨音能力大部分人都不具备
* mrs.
* Miss 
* Ms

### W

Round your lips and let the air flow out. It feels like I'm blowing a balloon.

关键在于发音开始前的嘴型：像要吹气球前吸好气的动作，嘴形呈圆形。

### ??? tw qw

在two里面tw是一起读的

在twelve和twenty和between里面tw是分开发的，t要很快

**Your mouth will actually pronounce the T with the rounded lips of the w  sound. The t&w will be combined into one sound here.**

先按twelouv读，再把ou去掉，并且舌头改为轻放。

Twelve

Twitter

但是qw又是连起来读的

Quick

## skills

### 音节

一个元音(包括单元音和双元音)是一个音节  

重读就是那个元音拉长些，音调升高些  

英文发音中有发完整和一半就收住，这点跟中文不同

### 重读

重读就是加长所重读音节里的元音
* Canada Canada
* banana
* Biology
* photography photography
* I love it.
* I have to call him.
* Skyscraper

句子里重读的单词一样也要加长所重读单词的元音

* I love my class.
* I love my new job.
* You're really tall.
* It's hot.
* Let's go to the park.
* I got a job at the hospital.

### [ɾ] riddle, booty, center

舌头稍微翘起来弹舌

* Better
* getting better
* Ladder
* Later
* writing a letter
* Doesn't matter
* Little bit
* Italy
* Attack 
* yes it is
* Automatic
* Not at all 先not at, then at all
* A little bit of
* I'm a writer ai要发圆满，弹舌要轻一点。
* What are you
* Let it go let it go play it again let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go （it的t虽然不发音，但是有发音的动作，所以会造成i后面稍微的停顿）
* Nobody
* Get up 
* What's the matter 
* The butter tastes bitter
* Do you want some better butter
* get out of here.  get out.  out of
* all over
* Take over take over take over
* I got up at 11.
* Do you want to get in or get out?
* I bought it at a computer store.
* What a nice day it is.

### 连读
把音读到位自然就出来连读了，特别是n,l,u之类的

#### 辅元连读

ju其实算半元音，可以和其前面的辅音连读

* Thank you kju
* It's very kind of you vju
* not at all
* Get out of here
* stressed out
* All over all over
* get up
* Take over
* Just a little bit of
* What about it ice age
* I've seen the beginning of it, not all of it.
* Hey it is movie night. what movie do you want to watch.
* Good idea! I like it! Can't believe you haven't seen it before.
* All right. I'm gonna play it for you.
* Stop it
* workout
* Feel excited
* Confidence is the difference. 这里的confidence和is不连读，因为要强调confidence。一般不是句子里强调的关键词才连读。
* Sing a song不连读

#### 辅辅连读

* Get tired
* Got tired of it
* feel like
* last time
* You look cool in those jeans.
* good movie前面被略读的辅音的口型还是要做的
* Such a good movie
* Credit card
* Sit down
* The squirrel is so funny.
* Can't wait for next week
* Can't wait for next week
* Wow such a good movie
* I just can't get tired of it
* who doesn't
* don't look at me
* I tried to tell you last night

##### stops and continuants

Another way we categorize consonants besides voiced and voiceless is whether they are stops or continuants.

A stop is a consonant that is produced when we stop the airflow. "Job" is a stop because we cannot pronounce the 'b' continually like 'b' 'b' 'b'... A continue is a consonant that we can pronounce it continually as long as there are air in our lungs. I can say 'yesssss'.

A lot of people treat continuant like a stop. so take your time and fully pronounce the continuants. Prolong the continuants.

* Sometimes.
* have
* Do not release the stop if the stop is before a consonant.
* Pop music
* I love my new job.
* Job market
* Had this
* Job hunting
*  top model
* good boy
* that day
* not now
* No it's not
* I'm not that hot
* quite great
* you quiet right
* I can't go I can't go
* I can't do it
* I want that blue hat
* Robert, you might be right.
* It's not that different
* What did you eat last night?
* did you
* I can't wait for that flight. 虽然不发音，但是略微的停顿是有的。

#### 元元连读

##### 加j
![元元连读](元元连读.png)

* May I have some milk tea
* day off
* Mentium diamond. A human being Dean and Dale India India
* Day in and day out
* Lie on the floor. Lie要念完整
* The other
* I owe you an apology

##### 加w

![元元加w](元元加w.png)

* You are
* How are you
* How are you doing
* Do it for what
* Go away
* he's
* the best I ever had
* Say it
* who else
* I know it
* Just do it yourself. I'm gonna see Angelababy.
* I'm going to lie in my bed and watch her show. **Watch击穿her的h**
* May I have some milk tea?
* how lucky you are! when will you go? **will和you连读**
* I thought you were gonna see her in person

### [ʔ] rent, button, cotton

![喉塞音方法](喉塞音方法.png)

还是要做要发t或者d的动作的

喉塞音

when t or d followed by n

T的吞音，像嗯又不像嗯的音,丹田发音

会导致前面的元音略微变短

喉塞音的关键在于前面元音的收住和停顿。

发音t被声门闭塞的声音代替，以至于听起来像是在说话中停顿或者跳过了这个音节。在第一个音节末尾含住舌根的气息，然后在发第二个音节的时候才把它吐出来。

在第一个音节末尾含住舌根的气息，然后在发第二个音节的时候才把它吐出来。(fountain → foun'ain, button → but'en)

发音方法是闭塞，即是通过阻碍空气在声腔流动来发音。发音部位是声门，通过声门闭塞而发音。喉塞音就是不读出t/d来，突然收声缩短前面的元音

保持发t的动作，舌头抵上牙，由鼻孔出气流发n。

一顿的感觉

* uh oh
* Important
* eaten
* Certainly
* Certainly
* Beaten
* Hidden
* In the garden
* Midnight
* Burden
* button
* written
* Button button
* What I eat in a day
* What I eat in a day
* I am certain that's the tallest mountain.
* My cotton shirt has buttons.
* I have forgotten when the book was written.
* Martin was born in great Britain.

### 清浊 voiced and voiceless consonants


清音不送气

清音声带不震动

浊音声带震动

还有清音不送气的，不是浊音
* Adopted
* make it
* happen

有些不送气的清音发出来感觉声带震动的浊音是因为带着后面的元音，所有的元音都是浊音

汉语里面的bdg实际上不是浊音，而是清音不送气

A consonant can be either voiced or voiceless. All vowels are voiced.

A voiced consonant or vowel is pronounced with vibration of vocal cords.

Ed

The vowel before the voiced consonant is pronounced longer than the vowel before the voiceless consonant.

* Ice eyes
* Back bag
* Safe save
* Pick pig
* lock log
* Light lied
* Leaf leave

#### 浊音

**念出足够浊的浊音，或者说避免发成你说的"不送气清音"，我们的确可以采用在bdg等浊塞音前加一个相对应的鼻音m/n/ng来带动这个塞音。但是m只适用于同样是双唇音的b；而d更适合加n，g前加ng。其他的浊辅音也基本上是这样在前面加一个合适的鼻音来发音。**

所以，my baby的夸张浊音读法为：my m~mbaby! （m的持续时间根据你个人喜好控制）

这种方法需要注意的地方在于，并不是见到bdg等浊塞音就要在前面加鼻音，因为得看是否重读，以及前面是否有清音食之清化。

比如I know he's a baby, but I didn't know he's a fat baby.

前半句的baby因为是被强调的，而且前面是元音a，所以浊化程度比较高。

后半句的baby因为不被强调（旧信息），而且前面的是清音t，所以浊化程度很低，甚至没有。

#### 清清浊浊

单词后面加s，清音后面就发清音s，浊音后面就发浊音z
